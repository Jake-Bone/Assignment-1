      <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px;"> Analyst Detection Management with the NAB </h2>
        <p> As outlined within my <a href="itinterest.html" target="_blank" title="Jake's interest in IT">Interest in IT </a> page, my ideal role will be involved in the investigation and the prevention of cyber crime. </p>
        <p> Having located this role via <a href="seek.com.au">seek.com</a>, I found this will fit my <a href="jake.html" target="_blank" title="Personality profile">personality and passions perfectly. </a></p>

      <h3> The role description and its appeal: </h3>
        <p> The candidate that is selected for this role will be required to undertake a range of tasks, including the review and modeling of data in relation to locating and disrupting fraudulent behaviour within the National Australia Bank (NAB). This will include assisting with, and the investigation of, customer complaints of suspicious transactions and claims of having been scammed, whilst also proactively locating and determining trends of fraudulent behaviour to prevent further harm. There will be a large portion of the role based on monitoring and relaying information to executive personnel and stakeholders and collaborating with other passionate members of the team. </p>

        <p> I find the idea that I will one day have skills to analyse and counter security breaches and to detect and prevent fraudulent cyber activity extremely appealing. Being a hypothetical shield to protect a body corporate, especially a financial organisation as to ensure a criminal or criminal group aren't getting their hands on money that doesn't belong to them, would provide fantastic job satisfaction. </p>
        <p> And to top it off, this role will allow its employees to become a member of the Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists (ACAMS) and to receive additional training within this association. This sounds highly lucrative, making this my dream job with certainty. </p>

      <h3> The role's required qualifications: </h3>
        <p> NAB's ideal candidate will have a degree in Computer Science or a related data analyst discipline, alongside previous experience with databases and programming whilst also having a strong desire to stop fraud. </p>
        <p> The programming languages include SQL, Python and R, whilst there is a requirement to have knowledge of standard industry used data analysis software such as Splunk. </p>
        <p> It's fortunate that this role is catered for a recent graduate of university or for someone wanting to start in this data analysis field, making this an ideal entry role, and not one that would require any further qualification or experience. </p>

      <h3> My current qualifications: </h3>
        <p> Unfortunately, having only worked in the public sector, I have had no prior working experience or previous qualifications in a data analytics/fraud investigation role, other than completing complex public investigations with the Police. </p>
        <p> My investigations required numerous search warrants, collaborating with financial institutions and data analysis and review to produce files required for criminal prosecution. </p>
        <p> In 2020, I obtained a Diploma of Police Workplace Practice, whilst in 2016 I obtained a Cert III in Electrotechnology. </p>

      <h3> My plan to get into this career: </h3>
        <p>In order to get into this career, I will need to obtain a degree in Computer Science or Information Technology as a minimum, with the expectation of me potentially completing internships within the industry and a further graduate certificate in Data Analytics as further incentive for employment. (<i>Seek,</i> c.2022)  </p>
        <p>My goal is to Complete this Introduction to IT course along with a Introduction to Programming course. (<i>OUA,</i> c.2022) so I can begin my bachelor's degree in Information Technology. Once I've completed this, I can start working within the industry and potentially obtain a Graduate Certificate in Data Analytics/Cyber Security to get my foot in the door with organisations such as this. </p>
