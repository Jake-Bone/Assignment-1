  <h1><u> My Interest in Information Technology </u></h1>

  <div class="div1">
   <h2> Why do I love IT? </h2>

    <p> Information Technology has been the cornerstone of my life in virtually every way. </p>
    <p> Like a lot of young people of my generation, I was glued to our family computer growing up. I fell in love with how I could learn almost anything via academic computer software and how I could communicate with my friends and loved ones via gaming together, creating and distributing animations and other fun projects with one another and be together over social media. </p>
    <p> I've always been fascinated by how people use Information Technology to benefit human-kind by bringing out new and exciting inventions almost every day and I can't wait and see how the introduction of new and upcoming technologies will shape our future as a species.</p>

     <h2> How I've used IT in my previous careers </h2>
   <p> Whilst I haven’t had a career based solely on IT, I had been fortunate enough to be with the New Zealand Police for around four and a half years, where IT was vital in everything we did. </p>
   <p> As an example, I was required to securely make queries into suspects for investigation, update intelligence databases in real time for all other officers to access and transmit secure information over encrypted digital radio and telecommunication channels on a daily basis. </p>
   <p> Criminal activity is beginning to rise with the abundance of Information Technology, from fraudulent matters as simple as obtaining cash by deception for selling a false product over social media to significant money laundering and wire money transfer scams. </p>
   <p> My dream is to move into a career based solely on stopping this. </p>

   <div class="div1">
   <h2> Why did I choose RMIT University? </h2>
   <p> As I wanted to return home to Australia to be with my family and friends again, I decided to find <a href="job.html" title="My dream career" target="_blank">a career based on online forensic fraud prevention and security.</a></p>
   <p> Whilst I’m currently working full-time, I decided to dedicate my remaining time on following my passion with IT and justice and mix them into one. </p>
   <p> RMIT University has provided me with the opportunity to start working towards my dream career, as it allows me to work and study at the same time. I am entirely commmited on completing my degree in order to gain the knowledge required to transfer my skills into the IT workplace. </p>
   <p> I'm hoping to get into and complete a Bachelor of Computer Science, and upon completion of this degree, I will be looking at transferring into a career based in IT. </p>
   <p> My goal is to then complete a Master of Information Technology, Computer Science or Cyber Security whilst working in my new IT role to ensure I end up achieving my goal of becoming a fraud analyst or cyber security expert. </p>
   <p><i><a href="images/timeline.png" target="_blank"> I have created a rough timeline outlining my plans moving forward into this new world of IT and into my dream career: </a></i></p>

   <div class="div2">
   <h2> What do I expect to learn during my studies? </h2>
    <p> My main goal with studying with RMIT University is to expand upon my basic knowledge of computer technology and provide myself with the foundational skills I require to transition into my dream career of online fraud analysis. </p>
    <p> Within this course, I’m expecting to learn how Information Technology systems work on a theoretical level whilst also allowing me the ability to test out the practicality of these systems by applied learning, such as creating this website through Github. </p>
    <p> I believe that RMIT is capable of providing me with the required learning material for workplace environments as outlined within the course materials. I also note that it's shown to be ranked globally at #190 in QS' TopUniversities World University Ranking, with each year it showing gradual progress on becoming ranked higher. (<i>QS TopUniversities Ranking,</i> 2022).</p>
    <p> Thus, if I put in the work, and come with an open mind, I believe that I will learn a great deal about broad topics about computers, information technology systems and the ethics and impacts it has on society. </p>
